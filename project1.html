<p> My plans following graduation are far from cemented. I have many interests I would like 
to explore but too little time. As a political science major, law school seems like the logical
route following my undergraduate education, but I think I will at least defer my enrollment for
at least a year to pursue other opportunities. I am interested in working for a consulting firm,
pursuing some kind of international service opportunity such as the <b>Peace Corp</b>, or to 
continue working on the website I created this summer. </p>
