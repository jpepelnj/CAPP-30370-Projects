<h2>Summary</h2>
	<img src="StepBrothers.jpg" alt="Step Brothers"> 
	<p>Brennan Huff and Dale Doback are both about 40 
	when Brennan's mom and Dale's dad marry. The sons 
	still live with the parents so they must now share a room. 
	Initial antipathy threatens the household's peace and the 
	parents' relationship. Dad lays down the law: both slackers
	have a week to find a job. Out of the job search and their 
	love of music comes a pact that leads to friendship but more
	domestic disarray compounded by the boys' sleepwalking. Hovering 
	nearby are Brennan's successful brother and his lonely wife: the 
	brother wants to help sell his step-father's house, the wife wants
	Dale's attention, and the newlyweds want to retire and sail the 
	seven seas. Can harmony come from the discord? </p>

	<h3>Lead Actor: Will Ferrell
	<img src="WillFerrell.jpg" alt="Will Ferrell">
		<h4>Bio</h4>
		<p>A graduate of the University of Southern California, Will Ferrell became
		interested in performing while a student at University High School in Irvine,
		California, where he made his school's daily morning announcements over the 
		public address system in disguised voices. He started as a member of the Los Angeles
		comedy/improvisation group The Groundlings, where fellow cast members 
		Ana Gasteyer, Maya Rudolph and former "Saturday Night Live" (1975) repertory 
		players such as Laraine Newman, Jon Lovitz and Phil Hartman began their careers. 
		It was there he met Chris Kattan and the two became good friends and both went on
		to "Saturday Night Live" (1975) later. He has also appeared on several television 
		programs, including "Strangers with Candy" (1999), "Grace Under Fire" (1993) and 
		"Living Single" (1993) during his time at The Groundlings. Will also lent his voice
		to the armless and legless dad of cartoon family "The Oblongs".In 1995 he became a feature 
		cast member at "Saturday Night Live" (1975) during the show's 
		rapid re-casting. He was declared quite possibly the worst cast member ever during his first season. 
		However, his talents of impersonations and range of characters shot him forward to making him arguably 
		the greatest "Saturday Night Live" (1975) cast member ever. During his seven year run he is one of the 
		few cast members to ever be nominated for an Emmy for a performance and played George W. Bush during the
		2000 elections. He's appeared in every "Saturday Night Live" (1975) movie since his premiere on the show 
		in 1995. In 2002 he left "Saturday Night Live" (1975) and was the only cast member to ever receive a
		farewell from all the current cast members at the end of the season finale show. Since leaving the 
		show Will has pursued a career in films. In 2000 he married and now lives in L.A. </p>
